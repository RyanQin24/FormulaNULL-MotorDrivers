# About this Formula Null RC Car Project

Formula NULL was a 19-hour hardware hackathon focused on building RC race cars using repurposed e-waste. Teams were challenged to create a functional car within a volume constraint of 60cm Ã— 60cm Ã— 60cm.

I participated as part of Team Power Vector, a 3-member group consisting of:

- Alexander Jin-Scheltgen

- Ryan Qin

- Raymond Wu

 This repository includes:

ðŸ”‹ Schematics for the electrical system

ðŸ”§ C++ Firmware for the Arduino Uno based motor driver
